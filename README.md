### FAQ

#### Does IEX Trading require authentication or an API key?

No, the IEX API is currently open and does not require authentication to access its data.

#### What layout breakpoints values should I consider using?

It's fully up to you. The only requirement is to use 2 breakpoints: mobile and desktop.

#### Can I use state manager like NgRx?

No, you can use basic RxJS only.

#### What if I will prepare unit tests which are failing? Are they still counted in the evaluation?

No, only working unit tests will be counted. Think the unit test coverage is your additional points after the application score.

#### Available mockups are for the desktop version only. How the app should look for mobile?

It's up to you. Main goal is to make those version convenient on mobile devices.

#### What workflow should I start from?

Check the [evaluations](#evaluation) if you want work based on how we count your score.

#### What if I finished all the workflows when there is still some time left?

You submit the solution and take a rest or add some new feature you consider worth attention ðŸ˜‰
